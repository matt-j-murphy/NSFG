Note. MSA: Metropolitan Statistical Area, STI: sexually transmitted infection. All prevalence estimates account for the survey’s complex sampling design and were directly age-standardized using the 2010 U.S. Census and may not add to 100.0% due to rounding error.
  
*Women in our analytic sample were aged 15-44 years at the time of screening, but some were aged 45 years at the time of interview.
